General Comments:
  - The presence of the implementation of the fullmatrix made some confusion initially.
  - I don't like your choice to access the data with operator[], I would have prefered something like [i,j],
    or (i,j).
  - What is the purpose of the folder dump? Don't push if not needed, or remove it with git rm.
  - Where is your doxygen? Carefull, when dealing with documentation with doxygen you should let the user generate it.
